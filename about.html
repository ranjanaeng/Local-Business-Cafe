      <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Ranjana Kaushik</strong> — founder and head barista of Local Café. 
        After spending over a decade working in some of the finest cafés across Europe, I returned to my hometown to create something special for my community. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 12 years of experience in the coffee industry, I’ve mastered the art of crafting the perfect cup and curating comforting spaces for people to connect. 
        My certifications in coffee roasting and barista training reflect my commitment to quality and creativity.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Local Café opened its doors in 2021 with one goal: to bring people together through great coffee and genuine hospitality. 
        We started as a single counter with three stools, and thanks to the support of our community, we've grown into a beloved neighborhood hub.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to serve high-quality, ethically sourced coffee and locally inspired treats in a warm, welcoming environment. 
        We strive to uplift our local farmers, bakers, and artists by offering their goods and talents in our space.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a world where cafés are more than places to grab a drink — they’re spaces where people feel seen, heard, and valued.
        Local Café aims to lead that movement, one cup at a time.
